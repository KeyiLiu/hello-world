# hello-world
This is my first Git testing project, and it should be the time-honored "Hello World" program.

#Hello, pals! This is Peter Liu from Jilin University, it is very nice to meet you here gays.
#I have been seeking for an internship like this for a while, and obviously I have found my luck here. Since the third year of my college, I started to consider computer vision as my life-long passion and calling, after these couple of months' digging and delving, I have to admit that I have been completely blown away by the pure beauty and powerness of it. In the end, I hope that we will engage in good cooperation and chummy relationship, thank you.
